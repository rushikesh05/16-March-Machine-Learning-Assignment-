        "* Overfitting occurs when our model is too complex and fits the training data too closely, leading to poor generalization on new or unseen data. This means that the model may perform well on the training data, but not on new data. This can be caused by having too many features or not enough data. The consequences of overfitting are that the model is not useful for predicting new outcomes, and it may lead to false conclusions.\n",
        "\n",
        "* On the other hand, underfitting occurs when our model is too simple and fails to capture the underlying patterns in the data. This means that the model is not able to learn the relationships between the input and output variables, and as a result, it performs poorly on both the training and test data. This can be caused by having too few features or not enough training data. The consequences of underfitting are that the model is not useful for predicting new outcomes, and it may lead to incorrect conclusions.\n",

        "* To mitigate overfitting, we can use techniques such as regularization, cross-validation, and reducing the number of features. Regularization involves adding a penalty term to the cost function, which encourages the model to be simpler and reduces the risk of overfitting. Cross-validation involves splitting the data into multiple training and validation sets, which helps us evaluate the model's performance on new data. Finally, reducing the number of features can help simplify the model and make it less likely to overfit.\n",

Finally, adding more training data can help the model learn more about the underlying patterns in the data."

For example, regularization techniques can be used to reduce the model's complexity, thus reducing variance and preventing overfitting, while increasing the number of features can increase the model's flexibility, thus reducing bias and preventing underfitting."

If the training performance is much better than the validation performance, it indicates that the model is overfitting. On the other hand, if the model's performance is poor for both the training and validation sets, it indicates that the model is underfitting.\n",
